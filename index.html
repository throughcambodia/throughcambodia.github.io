           The Khlong Lat Mayom floating market is an authentic market where tourists can be counted on the fingers of the hand. In fact, this floating market is organized in 2 parts located on one side of the street. On the left side arriving from Bangkok you will find stalls selling typical fruits and vegetables and a little bit more "textile / souvenirs" with handmade items.

           Wat Pho in Bangkok was a nice surprise during our Thailand getaway. Imagine a little, an elongated Buddha 46 meters long, we had never seen that before! But it's not just the elongated Buddha to see at Wat Pho ... it's gone for the visit!
